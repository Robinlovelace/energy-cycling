Modelling the energy and emission savings of a 'Get Britain Cycling' scenario of modal shift

Cycling as a mode of transport has a wide range of immediate
benefits, ranging from more liveable streets and reduced
congestion to improved health and alertness of cyclists. Yet
some of the most important impacts may only be realised in
the future: from the perspective of unborn future
generations, cycling offers hope that civilisation can
operate without burning valuable fuel resources or polluting
the atmosphere. 
This paper asks: what would the energy and emissions savings
of a 'best case' scenario of modal shift to cycling be?
The scenario, presented in a separate paper, 
is a spatially disaggregated
 implementation of the All Party Parliamentary Cycling
Group's 'Get Britain Cycling' report, running to 2050.
Using best estimates for the current and future
efficiciencies of different travel modes, measured in
megajoules and grams of carbon dioxide per passenger
kilometre (MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm respectively), the energy and
climate impacts of these shifts are reported over time and,
at the level of Local Authorities, over geographical space.
The findings provide much needed quantitative evidence about
the environmental impacts of policies promoting active
travel and feed into wider debates about cost-effectiveness
in transport planning.
