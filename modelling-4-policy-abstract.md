# Modelling a scenario of modal shift to 'Get Britain Cycling'

Robin Lovelace, 2014

Cycling has received heightened political and academic attention since
the turn of the century. The humble bicycle is increasingly being seen
not only as an effective means of transport, but also as part of the 
solution to wider problems at the interface between the human economy
and the environment. Resource depletion, recession, climate change
and even obesity are symptoms of these issues that are threatening 
millions of lives worldwide. It is believed that cycling can help 
mitigate each of these in general terms yet seldom is this quantified. 
The paper aims to fill this knowledge gap. Based on a case study of 
cycling interventions in the UK, it asks, to what extent is modal shift
to cycling possible, based on 'best case' scenarios of policy intervention?
What would the wider implications of such a shift be?
The basis of this 'best case' scenario used will be the 
All Party Parliamentary Cycling Groups' Get Britain Cycling report 
(APPCG 2013). The APPCG report provides general guidance on what would
be needed for a radical modal shift to active travel (including the 
prerequisite of a minimum of 10 pounds per head spent on cycling per year
and a target of 25% of all trips made by bike by 2050) but provides 
little detail about the precise set of interventions that would make this 
transition happen. This research project aims to provide a more 
detailed vision of what the UK's transport system would look like if
25% of trips were made by bike, including plausible rates of change, 
estimation of which modes cycling would replace and a simulation of 
the extent to which demand reduction would be required. 
Analysis of the impact of past interventions informs estimation
of the kinds of intervention needed; a comparison of the 2001 and 2011 Census
provides insight into the places that would be likely to lead the transition 
and likely 'lagard' areas in this transition. The conclusion 
returns to the systemic problems facing civilisation and proposes a research 
agenda for modelling a transition to a sustainable transport 
system worldwide.
